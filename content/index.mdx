# Get started with Fastfony

[Fastfony](https://fastfony.com) is a [Symfony](https://symfony.com) boilerplate and starter kit that provides a solid foundation for building web applications. It includes a variety of features and tools to help you get started quickly and efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php),
2. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org),
3. [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download),
4. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download),
5. [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and
6. [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)

Be careful to the minimum versions requirements:

- PHP: 8.2
- Symfony CLI: 5.11
- Node: 22 with npm and _npx_

## Create new project

We recommend creating a new development project on a local development machine and follow the "Go to production" (soon available...) instructions to deploy it on a production server.

You can create a new project using one of the following methods:

### Solution 1 : From archive

Extract the download archive and in the root of the project, run the following command:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

If you want synchronize your new project with the template repository of Fastfony or Fastfony Pro, run the following command:

For Fastfony:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coopTilleuls/template-sync/main/template-sync.sh | sh -s -- https://github.com/fastfony/fastfony
```

For Fastfony Pro:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coopTilleuls/template-sync/main/template-sync.sh | sh -s -- git@github.com:fastfony/fastfony-pro.git
```

And then resolve conflicts, if any, and run `git cherry-pick --continue`.

Then, run the following command:

```bash
task start
```

### Solution 2 : From template repositories

Go on github in order to create your own repository from the template, with this link:
* for Fastfony: https://github.com/new?template_name=fastfony&template_owner=fastfony
* for Fastfony Pro: https://github.com/new?template_name=fastfony-pro&template_owner=fastfony

You can claim your access to the Fastfony Pro repository by sending e-mail to claim-repo-access@fastfony.com.

Then clone the repository and in the root of the project, run the following command:

```bash
task start
```
